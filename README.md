A junk drawer of git repos. Essentially, I'm not super interested in keeping these repos up-to-date with `mr`, but it's kinda useful to keep them around to look up stuff

(This drawer hangs out in wsl-projects, because it contains projects. But it's not as project-y as other projects. So... junk)

Since none of the repos under here are tracked by mr, `_mr-able` won't call out any and will consider this current folder clean
