A junk drawer for git repos, to be placed as a peer of other `mr`-tracked repos, to contain non-`mr`-updated repos.

Essentially, a place to keep the repos I don't want to track with `mr`.
I'm not super interested in keeping these repos up-to-date with `mr`, but it's kinda useful to keep them around to look up stuff (and especially keep track of them across computers).
Think like a screwdriver. I needed it around once. I might need it again. But there's no need to keep it maintained.

I usually put this drawer in a projects folder, because it contains projects. But it's not as project-y as other projects. So... junk

If none of the repos under here were tracked by mr, `_mr-able` wouldn't call them out. But if any are, `_mr-able` will help me find them so I can carry them around.
