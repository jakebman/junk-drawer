A junk drawer of git repos. Essentially, I'm not super interested in keeping these repos up-to-date with `mr`, but it's kinda useful to keep them around to look up stuff

(This drawer hangs out in wsl-projects, because it contains projects. But it's not as project-y as other projects. So... junk)

The repos contained in this directory are considered mr-tracked, because this junk-drawer folder is mr-tracked.
They're also considered git repos... because they are.
That makes them all "mr-tracked git repos". This isn't necessarily honest, but it does help `_mr-able` recognize that they're not to worry about.
