A junk drawer for git repos, to be placed as a peer of other `mr`-tracked repos, to contain non-`mr`-tracked repos.

Essentially, a place to keep the repos I don't want to track with `mr`.
I'm not super interested in keeping these repos up-to-date with `mr`, but it's kinda useful to keep them around to look up stuff.
Think like a one-time-use screwdriver. No reason to toss it, but no need to maintain it.

I usually put this drawer in a projects folder, because it contains projects. But it's not as project-y as other projects. So... junk

Since none of the repos under here are tracked by mr, `_mr-able` won't call out any and will consider this current folder clean
